# UUID Generate
**DISCLAIMER:** This UUID Generator uses the standard pseudo-random number generator which comes with Windows without any alterations to that algorithm and therefore should NOT be used for security-grade applications or applications requiring a high degree of randomness.

This is a UUID (A.K.A. GUID) generator that generates standard UUIDs (i.e. `f19b32ec-cfaf-32ee-35b9-37435f4bef3f`) and stores the new UUID in the UUID environmental variable (i.e. `%UUID%` or `!UUID!`).

If you work with UUIDs in bulk and have suggestions for more features, please don't hesitate to open a new issue to let me know and I'll try and make as many people happy with this script as reasonably possible. Some suggestions might be things like reading data from and/or writing data to CSVs, integration with QR codes and/or other barcodes, etc.
